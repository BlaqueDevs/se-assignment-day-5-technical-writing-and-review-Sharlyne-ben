Recognizing the audience's expertise level shapes how you present technical information by influencing the depth, terminology, and complexity of your content.

Layer Information: Start with basics and build up to more complex ideas for mixed audiences.
Examples and Analogies: Use relevant examples that resonate with the audience's experience.

## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
